# Go by Example
Working my way through the Golang tutorial at [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com).

1. Hello World
2. Values
3. Variables

## Running
To run the code snippets you need to have [Golang](https://golang.org) installed, and then you can use `go run` and `go build` to execute the code. For example:

```console
$ go run hello-world.go
hello world
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ./hello-world
hello world
```
